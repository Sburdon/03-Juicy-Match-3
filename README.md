# Juicy Match 3
Made a match 3 for class with some Juicy features

Followed along with videos to make a Juicy match 3

## Implementation
I added two different backgrounds, music, and tried to add a dying function

## References
Based on a Match-3 project created by [Mister Taft Creates](https://github.com/mistertaftcreates/Godot_match_3) (with an accompanying [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4vbr3u7UKWqwQlvwvgNcgDL1p_3hcNn2))

## Future Development

I would like to revisit so I can add more juicy features
